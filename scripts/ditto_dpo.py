Implementation of the DPO step in DITTO (Demonstration-Iterated Task Optimization).

This module implements the preference-based training phase of DITTO, which constructs
preference pairs dynamically during training to improve policy performance.

Hints:
1. The core DPO training loop can be adapted from the official implementation:
    https://github.com/thinking-machines-lab/tinker-cookbook/blob/main/tinker_cookbook/preference/train_dpo.py
2. Your main modifications should focus on:
    - Replacing SupervisedDataset with DITTODataset to handle dynamic preference construction
    - Implementing ReplayBuffer to cache historical outputs efficiently
    - Ensuring proper sampling ratios across the three comparison types
